I completed all of the user stories within the given amount of time, and began working on the extension. I am comfortable with many - to - many relationships with rails now. I tried to follow SRP and so made model methods for a few different things rather than calling an AR association in the view. Since getting feedback on the importance of testing model methods in the model spec, I attempted to do so for all methods including the Professor class method, .alpha.

I need to get a better understanding of how the test data is being set up in RSpec. My current understanding
was that, aside from a before :each block, each test's data lives independently of each other. However, when I tried running a model test for my class method .alpha for Professor, the test had unexpected, extra data in there which made my test fail. I am interested in learning more about this when we get our feedback on the ICs. I am fairly certain I had the method working properly, and in local host it displayed the data as expected, I just need to get an understanding of model test data.
